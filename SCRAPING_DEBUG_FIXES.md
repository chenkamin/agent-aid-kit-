# Scraping Debug Fixes - Oct 17, 2024

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Address Extraction Broken
**Problem:** Address was empty and city contained the full address
```
address: ""
city: "6215 Hosmer Ave Cleveland"
```

**Fix:** Completely rewrote the `extractAddressFromUrl()` function to properly parse URL format:
- URL: `https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/6215-Hosmer-Ave-Cleveland-OH-44105/33423858_zpid/`
- Now correctly extracts: `address: "6215 Hosmer Ave"`, `city: "Cleveland"`, `state: "OH"`, `zip: "44105"`

### 2. ‚úÖ Agent Information Always Null
**Problem:** `seller_agent_name`, `seller_agent_phone`, `seller_agent_email` all null

**Root Causes:**
1. **Property Details Actor ID not configured** - Still set to placeholder
2. **Address matching issues** - Extracted addresses not matching detailed data
3. **No visibility** - No logging to debug why extraction failed

**Fixes:**
1. Added **CRITICAL ERROR** check if actor ID not configured
2. Enhanced address matching with multiple format attempts
3. Added comprehensive logging at every step (see below)

### 3. ‚úÖ Home Type Detection Broken
**Problem:** All properties showing as "Other" and being filtered out

**Fix:** Home type is nested in `hdpData.homeInfo.homeType`, not at top level
- Updated to check: `prop.homeType` ‚Üí `prop.propertyType` ‚Üí `prop.hdpData?.homeInfo?.homeType`
- Also updated bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, price extraction

### 4. ‚úÖ Excessive Logging
**Problem:** 97 properties √ó multiple log lines = thousands of log entries

**Fix:** 
- Removed verbose per-property logging
- Added summary counts instead:
  ```
  üìä Property types found: { "Single Family": 85, "Condo": 10, "Other": 2 }
  üìä Cities found: { "cleveland": 50, "garfield heights": 30 }
  ```

## Critical: Actor ID Configuration

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** If you see this error:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
Property Details Actor ID is NOT configured!
Agent information will be NULL for all properties.

Please configure the actor ID in functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts line ~138
Replace 'YOUR_PROPERTY_DETAILS_ACTOR_ID' with your actual Apify actor ID
See ZILLOW_DETAILED_SCRAPING_UPDATE.md for setup instructions
```

**You MUST configure the Property Details Actor ID:**

1. Open `functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts`
2. Find line 138: `const PROPERTY_DETAILS_ACTOR_ID = 'YOUR_PROPERTY_DETAILS_ACTOR_ID';`
3. Replace with your actual actor ID (e.g., `'apify/zillow-property-scraper'`)
4. Deploy: `supabase functions deploy scrape-zillow`

## What to Check in Logs

### ‚úÖ Good Signs
- "Prepared X addresses for detailed scraping" (X > 0)
- "Mapped X unique address keys" (X > 0)
- "‚úÖ AGENT INFO EXTRACTED" appearing
- Success rate > 0%

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems
- "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No valid addresses collected!"
- "‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è" - Actor ID not configured
- "‚ùå NO DETAILED DATA FOUND" for all properties
- Success rate: 0%

## Debugging Steps

If agent info is still null after deploying:

1. **Check Actor ID**
   - Is it still `YOUR_PROPERTY_DETAILS_ACTOR_ID`?
   - Look for the CRITICAL ERROR in logs

2. **Check Address Matching**
   - Look at "Address lookup key" vs "Available addresses in detailsMap"
   - Do they match? (case-insensitive)

3. **Check Detailed Data Structure**
   - Look at "Detailed data keys" log
   - Is `listedBy` in the keys?
   - If not, the actor may return a different structure

4. **Check Actor Output**
   - Look at "Sample of detailed data" in logs
   - Does it match the expected structure with `listedBy` array?

5. **Manual Test**
   - Run your property details actor in Apify dashboard
   - With input: `{"addresses": ["6215 Hosmer Ave, Cleveland, OH 44105"], "extractBuildingUnits": "all", "propertyStatus": "FOR_SALE"}`
   - Verify output has `listedBy` array with agent info

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts`
   - Fixed `extractAddressFromUrl()` function
   - Added nested field extraction for home type, beds, baths, sqft, price
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout
   - Added actor ID configuration check
   - Added agent info extraction summary

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated function:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy scrape-zillow
   ```

2. **Configure the Property Details Actor ID** (if not done yet)

3. **Test with a small buy box** (1-2 properties)

4. **Review the logs** to see:
   - Are addresses being extracted correctly?
   - Is detailed data being fetched?
   - Is agent info being extracted?

5. **Share the logs** if issues persist - the new detailed logging will help diagnose any remaining problems

**The comprehensive logging will now tell you EXACTLY why agent info is null for each property!** üéØ
