# Buy Box Modal - Complete Feature Update

## ✅ All Features Implemented

The **"Create New Buy Box"** modal in Lists.tsx now includes all the new filtering features!

### What's New in the Modal

#### 1. 🏠 Property Types Multi-Select
**Location:** After Zip Codes, before Price Filter

- 7 property type checkboxes with icons:
  - 🏠 SFH (Single Family Home)
  - 🏘️ Multi Family
  - 🏢 Condo
  - 🏘️ Townhouse
  - 🌳 Lot/Land
  - 🏛️ Apartment
  - 🏬 Commercial

- **How it works:**
  - Check any combination you want
  - Leave empty to include all types
  - Selected types show below the grid

#### 2. 🎯 City/Neighborhood Filtering
**Location:** After Zip Codes, before Property Types

- **Two input fields:**
  - **Cities** (comma separated)
  - **Neighborhoods** (comma separated)

- **Smart Toggle:**
  - Appears automatically when you add cities or neighborhoods
  - Shows exactly what will be filtered
  - Example: "Will filter for: Garfield Heights, Cleveland"

- **Use Case:**
  - Zip code 44105 includes both Garfield Heights and Cleveland
  - Add "Garfield Heights" to Cities
  - Enable the toggle
  - Result: Only Garfield Heights properties, no Cleveland!
