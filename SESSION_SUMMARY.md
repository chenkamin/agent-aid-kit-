# Session Summary - Property Updates & Filters

## Issue 1: Slow Workflow Updates ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
When updating a property's workflow status, there was a 3-5 second delay before the UI reflected the change. For example:
- Filter properties by "Initial" 
- Update a property to "Not Relevant"
- Wait several seconds before it disappears from the list

### Root Cause
The app was using **invalidate-then-refetch** pattern, waiting for a full server roundtrip before updating the UI.

### Solution: Optimistic Updates
Implemented optimistic updates that:
1. **Update UI instantly** before server responds
2. Update database in background
3. Automatically rollback if error occurs
4. Sync with server after success

### Files Changed
- `src/pages/Properties.tsx`
  - Workflow state update (single property)
  - Bulk workflow update (multiple properties)
  - Fixed query keys from `user?.id` to `userCompany?.company_id`
  
- `src/pages/Activities.tsx`
  - Activity status updates
  - Fixed query keys

- `OPTIMISTIC_UPDATES_FIX.md` - Full documentation

### Result
‚ö° **Instant UI updates** - Properties now disappear/appear immediately when workflow changes

## Issue 2: Property Type Filter ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

### Requirement
User requested ability to filter properties by type in Buy Box using a multi-select interface:
- Only lots
- Only single-family homes
- Any combination of types

### Implementation

#### 1. Multi-Select UI (`src/pages/BuyBox.tsx`)
- Added checkbox grid with 7 property types:
  - üè† Single Family Home (SFH)
  - üèòÔ∏è Multi Family
  - üè¢ Condo
  - üèòÔ∏è Townhouse
  - üå≥ Lot / Land
  - üèõÔ∏è Apartment
  - üè¨ Commercial

- Visual improvements:
  - Checkboxes in responsive grid layout
  - Icons for each property type
  - Badge display of selected types
  - Hover effects on cards

#### 2. Property Type Normalization (`functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts`)
- Updated `normalizeHomeType()` function
- Added "Lot" recognition (land/lot)
- Added "Apartment" type
- Consistent normalization of Zillow's property type strings

#### 3. Scraping Filter (`functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts`)
- Automatic filtering during Zillow scraping
- Only saves properties matching selected types
- Detailed logging of filtered properties
- Works after price/sqft filtering

### Files Changed
- `src/pages/BuyBox.tsx` - Multi-select UI implementation
- `functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts` - Type normalization & filtering
- `PROPERTY_TYPE_FILTER.md` - Full documentation

### Result
üéØ **Precise targeting** - Users can now specify exactly which property types to import

## How to Test

### Test Optimistic Updates
1. Go to Properties page
2. Filter by "Initial" workflow
3. Open a property and change to "Not Relevant"
4. **Expected:** Property disappears **instantly** from list

### Test Property Type Filter
1. Go to Buy Box page
2. Create a new Buy Box
3. Select only "Lot" in Property Types section
4. Save the Buy Box
5. Run scraper for this Buy Box
6. **Expected:** Only lot/land properties are imported

## Documentation Created
- ‚úÖ `OPTIMISTIC_UPDATES_FIX.md` - Optimistic updates explanation
- ‚úÖ `PROPERTY_TYPE_FILTER.md` - Property type filter guide
- ‚úÖ `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Technical Improvements
1. **Better UX** - Instant feedback on all updates
2. **More efficient** - Reduced unnecessary server calls
3. **More precise** - Filter properties by type before import
4. **Better error handling** - Automatic rollback on failures
5. **Correct caching** - Fixed query keys throughout app
