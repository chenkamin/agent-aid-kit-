# ListedBy Debug Logging Guide

## What You'll See in the Logs

After deploying this version, you'll get **complete visibility** into why `listedBy` (agent info) is null. Here's what to look for:

### 1. Address Extraction (10% sample)
```
üìç URL: 1691-Harwich-Rd-Lyndhurst-OH-44124 ‚Üí "1691 Harwich Rd, Lyndhurst, OH 44124"
```
**Check:** Is the address being parsed correctly now?

### 2. Address Collection
```
üîç Collecting addresses for detailed scraping...
   ‚úì Address 1: 1691 Harwich Rd, Lyndhurst, OH 44124
   ‚úì Address 2: 6215 Hosmer Ave, Cleveland, OH 44105
üìã Prepared 85 addresses for detailed scraping
```
**Check:** Are addresses being collected? (should be > 0)

### 3. Detailed Scraping Function Call
```
üöÄ Starting detailed property scraping...
   Total addresses to scrape: 85

   üîç DETAILED SCRAPING FUNCTION CALLED
      Scraping detailed info for 50 properties...
      Actor ID: "YOUR_PROPERTY_DETAILS_ACTOR_ID"
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECK:** Is the Actor ID still `YOUR_PROPERTY_DETAILS_ACTOR_ID`?
- **If YES** ‚Üí That's your problem! Actor is not configured, returning empty array
- **If NO** ‚Üí Good, continue checking

### 4. Actor ID Not Configured Error
```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
   Property Details Actor ID is NOT configured!
   Agent information will be NULL for all properties.
```
**If you see this:** You MUST configure the actor ID before agent info will work!

### 5. Apify API Call
```
      Making Apify API call...
      API endpoint: https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/YOUR_ACTOR_ID/runs
      Apify response status: 200
```
**Check:**
- Status should be `200` or `201`
- If `404`: Actor ID doesn't exist
- If `401`: API token invalid
- If `403`: Permission denied

### 6. Results Retrieved
```
      Fetching results from dataset...
      Results response status: 200
      ‚úÖ Retrieved 50 detailed property records
      Sample record fields: address, listedBy, price, beds, ...
      Sample has listedBy: true
      Sample listedBy: [{"id":"LISTING_AGENT","elements":[{"id":"NAME","text":"John Smith"}...
```
**Check:**
- `Retrieved X detailed property records` - should be > 0
- `Sample has listedBy: true` - should be true!
- Look at the `Sample listedBy` structure

### 7. Batch Results
```
üì¶ Processing batch 1 (50 addresses)...
   Sample addresses in batch: 1691 Harwich Rd, Lyndhurst, OH 44124, ...
   ‚úÖ Batch returned 50 results
   Sample result keys: address, listedBy, price, beds, ...
   Sample result has listedBy: true
```
**Check:** `Batch returned X results` should be > 0

### 8. Address Mapping
```
üìã Creating address map from 50 detailed property records...
   Mapping property: 1691 harwich rd, lyndhurst, oh 44124
     All address variants: 1691 harwich rd, lyndhurst, oh 44124 | 1691 harwich rd
‚úÖ Mapped 100 unique address keys to detailed property data
```

### 10. Problems You Might See

#### Problem: Actor ID Not Configured
```
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
Property Details Actor ID is NOT configured!
```
**Solution:** Configure the Actor ID in `functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts` line 150

#### Problem: No Addresses Collected
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No valid addresses collected! Agent info will be null for all properties.
```
**Cause:** Address extraction from URLs is failing
**Check:** Look at address parsing logs

#### Problem: Batch Returned Zero Results
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Batch returned ZERO results!
```
**Causes:**
- Actor ran but found no properties (check Apify dashboard)
- Actor configuration incorrect (wrong input format)
- Addresses not matching what the actor expects

#### Problem: No listedBy Field
```
‚ùå NO listedBy field in detailed data
Available fields: address, price, beds, baths, ...
```
**Cause:** The actor you're using doesn't return `listedBy` field
**Solution:** 
1. Check the actor's output in Apify dashboard
2. Verify you're using the right actor
3. May need to adjust field extraction logic

#### Problem: listedBy Not an Array
```
‚ùå listedBy exists but is NOT an array
listedBy value: "some string or object"
```
**Cause:** Actor returns listedBy in different format
**Solution:** Adjust extraction logic based on actual format

#### Problem: No LISTING_AGENT Section
```
‚ùå LISTING_AGENT section not found in listedBy array
Available section IDs: BROKER, SELLER, ...
```
**Cause:** Actor uses different section IDs
**Solution:** Check what IDs are available and adjust code

### 11. Success Rate Summary
```
üìä AGENT INFO EXTRACTION SUMMARY:
   ‚úÖ Properties with agent info: 65
   ‚ùå Properties without agent info: 20
   üìà Success rate: 76%
```
**Target:** Success rate should be > 50%
- 0% ‚Üí Actor ID not configured or actor not returning data
- 20-50% ‚Üí Address matching issues
- 50-80% ‚Üí Normal (some properties don't have agent info)
- 80-100% ‚Üí Excellent!

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

When you run "Create & Scrape", check these in order:

1. ‚òê **Addresses collected?** Look for "Prepared X addresses" (X > 0)
2. ‚òê **Actor ID configured?** Should NOT be `YOUR_PROPERTY_DETAILS_ACTOR_ID`
3. ‚òê **Detailed scraping called?** Look for "üîç DETAILED SCRAPING FUNCTION CALLED"
4. ‚òê **Apify API success?** Look for "Apify response status: 200"
5. ‚òê **Results returned?** Look for "Retrieved X detailed property records" (X > 0)
6. ‚òê **Results have listedBy?** Look for "Sample has listedBy: true"
7. ‚òê **Address matching working?** Look for "‚úÖ Found detailed data"
8. ‚òê **listedBy extraction working?** Look for "üìû ‚úÖ AGENT INFO EXTRACTED"
9. ‚òê **Success rate > 0%?** Look at summary

## Deploy and Test
