# Neighborhood Storage Enhancement - Implementation Complete

## Update Summary
Enhanced the neighborhood filter to **store the verified neighborhood name** in the properties table when a property passes the neighborhood filter.

## What Changed

### 1. OpenAI Function Enhancement ✅
**File:** `functions/verify-neighborhood/index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Modified OpenAI prompt to return the **specific neighborhood name** instead of just YES/NO
- Updated response to include `matchedNeighborhood` field
- Enhanced logging to show which neighborhood matched

**Before:**
```json
{
  "isInNeighborhood": true,
  "raw_response": "YES"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "isInNeighborhood": true,
  "matchedNeighborhood": "Tremont",
  "raw_response": "Tremont"
}
```

### 2. Scraper Updates ✅
**File:** `functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Created `propertyNeighborhoodMap` to track verified neighborhoods
- Captures `matchedNeighborhood` from verification API response
- Stores neighborhood in properties table when inserting new properties

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// Get verified neighborhood if available
const verifiedNeighborhood = propertyNeighborhoodMap.get(listingUrl) || null;

newListings.push({
  // ... other fields
  neighborhood: verifiedNeighborhood,  // ← NEW!
  // ... more fields
});
```

### 3. Daily Update Integration ✅
**File:** `functions/update-properties-daily/index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Same neighborhood tracking as scraper
- Stores verified neighborhood for new properties discovered in daily updates

## How It Works

### Flow:

1. **Buy box has neighborhood filter enabled**
   - `filter_by_neighborhoods = true`
   - `neighborhoods = ["Tremont", "Ohio City", "Downtown"]`

2. **Property passes verification**
   - OpenAI determines property is in "Tremont"
   - Returns `matchedNeighborhood: "Tremont"`

3. **Property is saved with neighborhood**
   - `neighborhood` field stores "Tremont"
   - Visible in properties table
   - Can be used for filtering/reporting

### Example Result in Database:

```sql
SELECT address, city, neighborhood FROM properties WHERE buy_box_id = 'xxx';
```

| address | city | neighborhood |
|---------|------|--------------|
| 123 Main St | Cleveland | Tremont |
| 456 Oak Ave | Cleveland | Ohio City |
| 789 Elm St | Cleveland | Downtown |

## Benefits

✅ **Data Enrichment**
- Properties now have verified neighborhood information
- Useful for reporting and analysis
- Helps track which neighborhoods are most active

✅ **Audit Trail**
- Know exactly which neighborhood the AI matched
- Can verify AI decisions
- Useful for quality control

✅ **Future Features**
- Filter properties by neighborhood in UI
- Group/analyze by neighborhood
- Neighborhood-specific metrics

✅ **Only for Filtered Properties**
- Neighborhood field only populated when buy box has neighborhood filter enabled
- Other properties have `null` in neighborhood field
- Clear distinction between AI-verified vs. regular properties

## Technical Details

### Database Field
- **Column:** `properties.neighborhood` (TEXT)
- **Already existed** in schema - no migration needed
- **Nullable:** Yes (only populated when neighborhood filter is active)

### OpenAI Integration
- **Model:** GPT-4o-mini
- **Prompt:** Returns exact neighborhood name from provided list
- **Fallback:** Returns "NO" if not in any neighborhood
- **Validation:** Checks if response is not "NO" (case-insensitive)

### Data Flow
```
Property → OpenAI Verification → matchedNeighborhood
                ↓
    Store in propertyNeighborhoodMap
                ↓
    Insert into properties.neighborhood
```

## Files Modified

### Updated Files:
- `functions/verify-neighborhood/index.ts` - Enhanced to return neighborhood name
- `functions/verify-neighborhood/README.md` - Updated documentation
- `functions/scrape-zillow/index.ts` - Added neighborhood storage
- `functions/update-properties-daily/index.ts` - Added neighborhood storage
- `NEIGHBORHOOD_STORAGE_UPDATE.md` - This document

## Testing

To verify the feature works:

1. Create a buy box with neighborhoods specified
2. Enable the neighborhood filter
3. Run scraping
4. Check the properties table:
   ```sql
   SELECT address, city, neighborhood 
   FROM properties 
   WHERE buy_box_id = 'your-buy-box-id'
   AND neighborhood IS NOT NULL;
   ```
5. Verify that `neighborhood` field contains the matched neighborhood name

## Example Query

```sql
-- Count properties by neighborhood
SELECT neighborhood, COUNT(*) as property_count
FROM properties
WHERE buy_box_id = 'your-buy-box-id'
AND neighborhood IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY property_count DESC;
```

Result:
```
neighborhood | property_count
-------------|---------------
Tremont      | 45
Ohio City    | 32
Downtown     | 28
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All changes implemented and deployed. The neighborhood filter now stores the verified neighborhood name for every property that passes the filter.
